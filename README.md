# Bazaar-Flipping-Resource
I'm glad you've found your way here, I never expected anyone else to read this. This is a resource for Hypixel Skyblock, it contains some live Bazaar statistics and incoporates some calculations for a easier time when decision making.

I hope you enjoy using this and I will probably keep updating this as long as I play the game. If you find any problems/issues or places to improve, don't hesitate to send it my way. I'll try to learn as much as I can.

# About Me
This is just a small project that I started for fun to pick coding back up. I tried to make it as user friendly as I can, but using Github for the first time isn't helping a lot. I started playing just as the Bazaar Update happened and I was just interested in making a one-stop-shop for all information regarding the Bazaar. I didn't have much background knowledge in coding as I've only done Javascript and a little bit of java. (Definitly not enough to understand the Public API files)
